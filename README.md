# construction-website

This was a freelance project that I did for the construction company which needed a website for all of their management from managing the pays of their labors to scheduling ,contracts and  resources. All these were managed by the website. This was developed using Html and css for designing, php for server side coding with mySql server database and along with javascript and AJAX.
